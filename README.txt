This is a from-scratch reproduction of the Tron client used in the Orbis Challenge of 2014. The challenge involved creating an AI script to compete against other AI scripts in a game of Tron.

This reproduction, instead of displaying the game state in a GUI as the original client did, displays the state in the form of outputs to the terminal (a la Nethack). At present, powerups have not been implemented yet, and human control is not present (due to lag making human gameplay very difficult). Other things are mostly the same as in the original Tron client.

This package includes the AI that me and my partner created as our submission to the Orbis Challenge.
